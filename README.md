Welcome to my CS50W Project 3 - Mail! This project implements a front-end for an email client, making API calls to send and receive emails.

## Demo

Watch the project demo on YouTube: [CS50W Project 3 Demo](https://youtu.be/AIDLfAxs1s8).

## Overview

The project focuses on creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS for styling. The primary file for implementation is `inbox.js`. All the essential functionalities are implemented as per the project specifications, and SCSS is utilized for enhanced styling.

## Features
